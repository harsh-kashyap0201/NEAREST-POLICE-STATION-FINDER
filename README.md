# NEAREST POLICE STATION FINDER
<hr>
A C Program  To Find The Nearest Police Station And Tell The Shortest Route To Reach The Required Location  Of A Hypothetical City (Based On Dijkstra's Algorithm)
In this project I tried to make code a program which can find nearest police station from a location and tell the shortest path to reach there.I used dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for searching shortest path and distance of that path. I have used an imaginary map of a locality in which there are 9 houses and 3 police stations. This idea can be extended to more number of houses and police stations
